# (practical-python->racket)

Recently, renowned Python expert [David Beazley](http://www.dabeaz.com) generously open-sourced his [Practical Python Programming](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/) course. I'm attempting to translate the examples and exercises into [Racket](https://racket-lang.org).

I've documented my attempts by [blogging](https://peterwawood.blogspot.com) about them. This reposistory holds the translated examples and exercises.
